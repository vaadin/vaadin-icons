[Vaadin Icons](https://vaadin.com/icons) is a set of 600+ icons designed for web applications. Free to use, anywhere!

Visit **https://vaadin.com/icons** for more information and instructions how to get started using them.

## Installation

The Vaadin components are distributed as Bower and npm packages.
Please note that the version range is the same, as the API has not changed.
You should not mix Bower and npm versions in the same application, though.

Unlike the official Polymer Elements, the converted Polymer 3 compatible Vaadin components
are only published on npm, not pushed to GitHub repositories.

### Polymer 2 and HTML Imports compatible version

Install `vaadin-icons`:

```sh
bower i vaadin/vaadin-icons --save
```

Once installed, import it in your application:

```html
<link rel="import" href="bower_components/vaadin-icons/vaadin-icons.html">
```

### Polymer 3 and ES Modules compatible version

Install `vaadin-icons`:

```sh
npm i @vaadin/vaadin-icons --save
```

Once installed, import it in your application:

```js
import '@vaadin/vaadin-icons/vaadin-icons.js';
```
